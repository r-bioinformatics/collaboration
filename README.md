Welcome to the r/bioinformatics code repository.  

Here are the rules - which may be subject to change.

1.  All code checked in must be in python (to start... we may change this.)
2.  All code must pass pylint - or have pylint ignore statements.
3.  All code must pass code review by one "senior" python developer. 

How to do code review:

How to propose new ideas:
For now, it is best to put new ideas onto the project ideas page, following the
instructions contained there. This page and the slack channel will be used for much of 
our early brainstorming. As the ideas get more fleshed out, we'll create a folder
for formal proposals. Until that point though, please use the ideas page. 

How to join the project:

Please join our slack channel by sending a PM to apfejes on reddit.
